<h2>Reading 1 - Reflection</h2>
<p>In contemporary culture, photography functions as a version of reality reduced to image—as a form of proof. Yet what we accept as proof is not reality itself, but a selected surface of it. When Susan Sontag writes that “every photograph seems to have a more innocent relation to visible reality,” she points to the way photographs appear truthful and transparent. When we read a text, we know it reflects the author’s perspective. A photograph, however, is often perceived as reality itself—neutral, objective, factual. But as Sontag emphasizes, every photograph is a chosen and framed moment; it is not the whole of reality, but an interpreted fragment.I notice this tension in my own relationship with photography. When I take pictures while traveling or during important moments, I feel as if I am “documenting” reality. The photograph becomes proof that something truly happened. It confirms my presence. In this sense, photography functions as evidence. Yet I also realize that photographing an experience can interrupt it. Instead of being fully present in the moment, I begin evaluating it visually: Is this photogenic? Is the light right? Should I change the angle? Taking a photograph freezes the experience and transforms it from something lived into something that can be possessed as an image.At this point, I begin to ask myself: If framing a moment is a kind of power, what does that power turn me into? With a camera in my hand, I feel active; but this activity is often the activity of distance rather than participation. Instead of inhabiting the moment, I choose to fix it. Photography thus becomes more than a recording device—it turns into an aesthetic filter that I place between myself and the world.</p>
<p>This no longer feels like merely a personal choice. Over time, photography has evolved from an artistic practice into a social ritual. Birthdays, travels, graduations, protests—almost every social experience is now intertwined with the obligation to produce images. Documenting is no longer optional; it has become the norm. Photography shifts from creative expression to a standardized behavior. When to shoot, how to shoot, how to share—these are guided by pre-existing aesthetic codes.In a world where we constantly produce and consume images, everything is reduced to a photographable surface. This reduction is not entirely negative; photography can indeed make the invisible visible. It can bring distant suffering before our eyes, carry overlooked realities into public space, and activate an already existing sense of conscience. Sometimes a single image can make an issue tangible, strengthening political awareness by confronting abstract debates with a human face.Yet the same mechanism can work in the opposite direction. As images multiply, shock diminishes; with repetition, emotion weakens. Pain becomes ordinary, tragedy becomes part of the feed. One day war, the next day fashion, then a disaster headline—everything circulates within the same aesthetic surface. Within this density, our reflex as viewers may dull rather than sharpen. Seeing becomes easier, but responding becomes harder. Photography therefore holds the potential both to intensify sensitivity and to produce desensitization.</p> 
<p>This contradiction forces me to reconsider my own position. If producing images is unavoidable, then the issue is not simply to “show,” but to take responsibility for how I show. Photography can make the world feel more accessible, yet it can also transform it into a consumable surface. Whether I remain on that surface or attempt to go beyond it depends on my stance—both as a producer and as a viewer.When creating an image, I need to question which gaze I am reproducing, which reality I am simplifying, and which emotions I may be aestheticizing. Likewise, when encountering an image, I can choose not to consume it passively, but to consider the context behind it. This awareness transforms photography from an automatic reflex into a conscious decision.</p>
